### Plant-animal interactions network datasets
#
### _WORKING ON IT!!!!_
#
My network datasets, with metadata. A repository of my own data on plant-animal interaction networks, to keep them centralized and readily updated.

Most of these data are available in other public repositories or as Supplementary Data in papers already published. As a live and continuously improving project, some of these network datasets, are updated with new records and field observations. Thus, relatively minor changes have been made to the datasets since the early publications. This repository includes the most updated datasets.

In addition, I'm also collecting here other published data on plant-animal interaction networks. These are readily available in other public repositories (e.g., [NCEAS](http://www.nceas.org/)).

The datasets include  filenames with different codes:
- `sd`: seed dispersal.
- `po`: pollination.
- `b##`: binary network.
- `w##`: weighted network.
- `_adj`: adjacency matrix).
- `_fru`: weights based on number of fruits eaten (usually for adjacency matrices derived from faecal samples).
- `_vis`: weights based on visitation data; visit data can be also re-weighted by no. fruits per visit, resulting in total feeding records (one feedig record= one fruit "touched").
- `frqapp`: weights based on frequency of appearance (usually for adjacency matrices derived from faecal samples).
For some networks, both the binary and weighted matrices are provided.
