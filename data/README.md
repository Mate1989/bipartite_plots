### Plant-animal interactions network datasets
#
### _WORKING ON IT!!!!_
#
My network datasets, with metadata. A repository of my own data on plant-animal interaction networks, to keep them centralized and readily updated.

Most of these data are available in other public repositories or as Supplementary Data in papers already published. As a live and continuously improving project, some of these network datasets, are updated with new records and field observations. Thus, relatively minor changes have been made to the datasets since the early publications. This repository includes the most updated datasets.

In addition, I'm also collecting here other published data on plant-animal interaction networks. These are readily available in other public repositories (e.g., [NCEAS](http://www.nceas.org/)).

The datasets include (`sd`: seed dispersal; `po`: pollination; `b##`: binary network; `w##`: weighted network).
